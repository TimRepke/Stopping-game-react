# Stopping Game React

This is the frontend application for the Stopping Game project, built with React, TypeScript, and Vite.

## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

*   **Node.js**: v18.0.0 or higher is recommended.
*   **npm** (Node Package Manager) or **yarn**.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already):
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd Stopping-game-react
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Configuration

This project requires certain environment variables to run correctly.

1.  **Create a `.env` file** in the root directory of the project.
2.  Add the necessary variables. You can use `.env.example` as a reference.

    **Example `.env` content:**
    ```env
    API_URL="http://localhost:3000/"
    ```

    > **Note**: The `.env` file is ignored by git to protect sensitive information and local configurations. Do not commit it to the repository.

## Running the Application

### Development Mode
To start the development server with Hot Module Replacement (HMR):

```bash
npm run dev
```
The application will usually be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Production Build
To build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```
This enables type checking and generates optimized static files in the `dist` directory.

To preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

### Linting
To check the code for linting errors:

```bash
npm run lint
```

## Gitignored & Local Files

The following files and directories are critical for the setup but are not committed to the repository. Ensure you have them set up locally:

*   **`.env`**: Contains environment variables (e.g., API endpoints). See configuration section above.
*   **`node_modules/`**: Generated by `npm install`.
*   **`dist/`**: Generated by `npm run build`.

## Project Structure

*   **`src/`**: Source code for the React application.
*   **`public/`**: Static assets.
*   **`vite.config.ts`**: Vite configuration.
*   **`tsconfig.json`**: TypeScript configuration.
